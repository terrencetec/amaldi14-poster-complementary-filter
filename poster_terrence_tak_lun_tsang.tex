			\begin{block}{Introduction}
%				Seismic isolation for ground-based interferometric gravitation-wave detectors plays a crucial  role for suppressing the displacement level of the main optics so 1) the main optics are sufficiently stable to not cause lock-loss of the interferometer, and 2) displacement noise at detection band ($>10\,\text{Hz}$) does not compromise the sensitivity of the detector.
%				\begin{enumerate}
%					\item the main optics are sufficiently stable to not cause lock-loss of the interferometer, and 
%					\item displacement noise at detection band (> 10 Hz) does not compromise the sensitivity of the detector.
%				\end{enumerate}
				\medskip

%						At higher frequencies, the displacement of the optics due to seismic noise is suppressed passively by suspending the optics with multiple-stage pendulum (suspension).
%						At lower frequencies, the residual motion of the optics is dominated by resonances excited by the ground motion.
%						While passive isolation is only effective at frequencies higher than the resonances, the residual motion of the optics at lower frequencies is reduced by active isolation using control systems.
					Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors require active control systems at low frequency to attenuate seismic noise induced displacement for the interferometer main optics.
					Such active isolation systems utilize local displacement sensors for feedback control.
					While the control performance of suspensions is limited by the sensors, it's desirable for sensors to be as low-noise as possible.
					In this work, we will describe a sensor fusion architecture that combines two sensors with different noise characteristics to obtain a virtual ``super sensor'' that has overall better noise performance.

				We apply the so-called ``complementary filters'' on the sensors and the signals are then summed to become the readout of the super sensor.
				Complementary filter designs were proposed previously \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv,vanHeijningen:2018cpc,low_frequency_optimization_and_performance_of_advanced_virgo_seismic_isolation_system}, but they were not suboptimal.
				More importantly, besides heuristics, it was not clear how exactly the filter shapes were constrained according to the sensor noises in question.
				Here, we propose to formulate the complementary filter problem as an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ optimization problem and synthesize the filters, which optimally combine the sensors, using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method.
%				In particular, we're interested in using feedback systems that manipulate displacement signals from sensors and feedback to the suspension via actuators.
%				While such control systems are effective in reducing the displacement level suspension at the control band, control noises are introduced at higher frequencies.
%				To satisfy the displacement noise requirements, control regulators need to be roll-off, which limits the amount of attenuation from the feedback system.
%				Since the control noise is dominated by sensing noise, lowering the sensing noise at higher frequencies enables the possibility of a greater control gain at lower frequencies, which makes the optics less susceptible to seismic disturbance.	
%				
%				\medskip
%				
%				Here, we will describe a sensor fusion technique, which combines multiple sensors with different noise characteristics using complementary filters.
%				The combined ``super sensor'' has an overall better noise performance, which can potentially enhance suspension control performance that ultimately translates to a more stable interferometer with lower detector noise.
%				This technique is used particularly for the preisolator stage, which is closest to the ground and furthest from the optics, of the Type-A and Type-B suspensions, where relative displacement sensors and inertial sensors were both used for feedback control.
%				So, we will describe a method that can be used to synthesize complementary filters, using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method, that optimally combine two sensors.

				\begin{columns}[t, onlytextwidth]
					\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
						Fig.~\ref{fig:two-sensor} shows a the block diagram typical two-sensor sensor fusion configuration using complementary filters.
						The two sensors are each filtered with filters $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ respectively.
						We required that the super sensor measuring the same signal that the two sensors are reading, so the filters must be complementary, i.e.
						\begin{equation}
							H_1(s) + H_2(s) = 1\,.
							\label{eqn:complementary}
						\end{equation}
					\end{column}
					\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}

							\caption{Two-sensor complementary filter configuration.}
							\label{fig:two-sensor}
						\end{figure}
					\end{column}
				\end{columns}
			
			\medskip
			
			The super sensor noise then reads
			\begin{equation}
				N_\text{super}(s) = H_1(s)N_1(s) + H_2(s)N_2(s)\,.
				\label{eqn:noise_super}
			\end{equation}
			So, the goal is to design the complementary filters $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ such that $N_\text{super}(s)$ is minimized in some sense, or exhibit desirable noise characteristics.
			
			\medskip
			
%			In previous work, there were proposed complementary filter designs that tackles the problem by matching the frequency-dependency of the sensing noises and the roll-off of the filter \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv, vanHeijningen:2018cpc}.
%			However, the filter shapes are too simple and is not flexible.
%			Undoubtedly, it is possible to improve the noise performance by better shaping of the filters.
%			Indeed, this was done in \cite{low_frequency_optimization_and_performance_of_advanced_virgo_seismic_isolation_system}, where the filter is shaped to minimize seismic noise coupling in the relative displacement sensors.
%			But, this raises another problem where the filters are tuned manually by heuristics, which may suboptimal and non-reproducible due to the human factor.
%			Therefore, we seek to find a method that can automatically generate optimal complementary filters according to the sensing noises themselves.

					This is where $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method comes in.
					$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method is used to synthesize regulator for feedback systems but is recently proposed for synthesizing complementary filters with frequency-dependent specification \cite{Thomas:2019}.
					And, It was shown that the method successfully reproduced one of the complementary filters at LIGO \cite{Matichard:2015} using the same specifications.
					To use $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method, the input-output system is first represented in the generalized plant representation as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:generalized_plant_representation}.

			In the figure, $w$ are the inputs, $z$ are the error signals to be minimized, $u$ are the manipulated variables, $v$ are the measurement signals, $\mathbf{P}(s)$ is the open loop plant, and $\mathbf{K}(s)$ is the closed-loop regulator.
			The close-loop response can be written as
			\begin{equation}
				z=\mathbf{G}(s)w\,,
			\end{equation}
			%			where $\mathbf{G}(s) = P_{11}(s) + P_{12}(s)\mathbf{K}(s)\left(I-P_{22}(s)\mathbf{K}(s)\right)^{-1}P_{21}(s)$ is the closed-loop transfer function matrix of the system.
			where $\mathbf{G}(s)$ is the transfer function matrix from the inputs $w$ to the errors $z$.

			$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ synthesis will then generate a regulator $\mathbf{K}_\infty(s)$, which minimizes the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm of the closed-loop transfer function $\mathbf{G}(s)$.
			The definition of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm is more involved and its discussion is skipped for brevity.
%			The $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm of the transfer function matrix is defined by
%			\begin{equation}
%				\left\Vert\mathbf{G}(j\omega)\right\Vert_\infty = \sup_\omega\left(\bar\sigma(\mathbf{G}(j\omega))\right)\,,
%			\end{equation}
%			where $j$ denotes the imaginary number, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\sup$ denotes the supremum, and $\bar\sigma(\mathbf{G}(j\omega))$ is the maximum singular value of $\mathbf{G}(s)$ at $\omega$.

%					Although everything about $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method so far has been discussed under the context of feedback control, it can also be used to synthesize complementary filters.
					Consider the generalized plant architecture as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:generlized_plant_complementary_filter}, which is a slight modification from that of \cite{Thomas:2019}.
					Here, $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ are some uncorrelated stochastic processes with unit magnitude.
					$\hat{N}_1(s)$ and $\hat{N}_2(s)$ are transfer function models of the noises $N_1$ and $N_2$.
					$W_1(s)$ and $W_2(s)$ are some weighting functions, which can be used to specify the (inverse) frequency-dependent specification of the sensing noises $N_1$ and $N_2$ respectively.

			Minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm of this plant will give optimal filters $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)\equiv 1-H_1(s)$ that best filter the noises $N_1$ and $N_2$ according to the specifications.
			It follows that if we set $W_1(s)=1/\hat{N}_2(s)$ and $W_2(s)=1/\hat{N}_1(s)$, the requirements of $N_1$ is set to $N_2$ when $N_1\gg N_2$, and vice versa.
			These weights are reasonable specifications if there's no specific requirements for the sensing noises because over-suppressing one of the noises is not useful as there exists a lower bound defined by the one of $N_1$ or $N_2$.
			
%			The closed-loop transfer function reads
%			\begin{equation}
%				\mathbf{G}(s) = \begin{bmatrix}H_1(s)\hat{N}_1(s)W_1(s) & H_2(s)\hat{N}_2(s)W_2(s)\end{bmatrix}\,,
%			\end{equation}
%			where we've substitute $(1-H_1(s))$ with $H_2(s)$ due to Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:complementary}.
%			
%			\medskip
%			
%			The plant has a maximum singular value of
%			\begin{equation}
%				\bar\sigma(\mathbf{G}(j\omega)) \approx \max{(H_1(j\omega)\hat{N}_1(j\omega)W_1(j\omega),H_2(j\omega)\hat{N}_2(j\omega)W_2(j\omega))}\,,
%			\end{equation}
%			Now, if we set $W_1(s)=1/\hat{N}_2(s)$ and $W_2(s)=1/\hat{N}_1(s)$, then $\bar\sigma(\mathbf{G}(s))$ can be interpreted as the ratio between the super sensor noise and the lower bound of the sensing noise, assuming that the super sensor noise is dominated one of the filtered sensing noises, which is generally true except at the cross-over frequency.
%			Minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm would then be approximately minimizing the maximum difference of the log super sensor noise and the log noise lower bound.

				Using the noise models $\hat{N}_1(s)$ and $\hat{N}_2(s)$, complementary filters were synthesized using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method as described in the methodology section.
				The resulting complementary filters are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:complementary_filters_hinfinity}.

				%				As can be seen, notch-like feature at around $0.2\,\text{Hz}$ is present in the low pass filter.
				%				Complementary filters from advanced LIGO \cite{Matichard:2015} and Virgo \cite{low_frequency_optimization_and_performance_of_advanced_virgo_seismic_isolation_system} also exhibit similar behavior, but the feature is clearly missing from that of \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv} and \cite{vanHeijningen:2018cpc}.
				%				This is a designed feature to provide additional seismic noise attenuation in the relative displacement sensor readout.
				%				Using the proposed method, we arrived at the same design feature by optimization using no additional information rather than the sensing noise themselves.
				
				Fig.~\ref{fig:super_sensor_noise_tf} shows the predicted super sensor noise defined by
				\begin{equation}
					\left\vert \hat{N}_\text{super}(j\omega)\right\vert = \left[\left\vert H_1(j\omega)\right\vert^2\left\vert \hat{N}_1(j\omega)\right\vert^2 + \left\vert H_2(j\omega)\right\vert^2\left\vert \hat{N}_2(j\omega)\right\vert^2\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\,.
				\end{equation}
				As can be seen, the super sensor noise here follows the shape of the lower bound of the sensing noises at all frequencies, which would indicate that the order of roll-off is critical at all frequencies.
				
			\medskip
			
			In Fig.~\ref{fig:super_sensor_noise_comparison}, we compare noise performance of the complementary filters from \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv}, \cite{vanHeijningen:2018cpc}, and the proposed method, which are denoted $N_\text{super, 1}$, $N_\text{super, 2}$, and $N_{\text{super},\mathcal{H}_\infty}$ respectively.
			The super sensor noises were calculated directly using the noises $N_1$ and $N_2$, instead of the transfer function models, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:noise_fit}.

					The cross-over frequency of the filters in \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv, vanHeijningen:2018cpc} were set to be the cross-over frequency of the sensing noises in Fig.~\ref{fig:noise_fit}, which is 0.0898 Hz in this case.
					This is the recommended way as discussed in \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv}.
					As can be seen, the amplitude spectral density of the super sensor noise from $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ filters are on par, if not lower, compared to the other two below $0.4\,\text{Hz}$ and is slightly higher above that.
					The shape of $N_{\text{super}, \mathcal{H}_\infty}$ at higher frequencies still follows that of the lower bound, which again, indicating that the sensing noises are critically roll-offed.
