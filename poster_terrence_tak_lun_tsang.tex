			\begin{block}{Introduction: Vibration Isolation Systems and Complementary Filters}
%				Seismic isolation for ground-based interferometric gravitation-wave detectors plays a crucial  role for suppressing the displacement level of the main optics so 1) the main optics are sufficiently stable to not cause lock-loss of the interferometer, and 2) displacement noise at detection band ($>10\,\text{Hz}$) does not compromise the sensitivity of the detector.
%				\begin{enumerate}
%					\item the main optics are sufficiently stable to not cause lock-loss of the interferometer, and 
%					\item displacement noise at detection band (> 10 Hz) does not compromise the sensitivity of the detector.
%				\end{enumerate}

%						At higher frequencies, the displacement of the optics due to seismic noise is suppressed passively by suspending the optics with multiple-stage pendulum (suspension).
%						At lower frequencies, the residual motion of the optics is dominated by resonances excited by the ground motion.
%						While passive isolation is only effective at frequencies higher than the resonances, the residual motion of the optics at lower frequencies is reduced by active isolation using control systems.
					Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors require vibration isolation systems (Fig.~\ref{fig:suspension_types}) to attenuate seismic noise induced displacement for the interferometer main optics.
					Vibration isolation systems utilize local displacement sensors for feedback control to achieve active isolation at lower frequencies.
					The control performance is limited by the sensors, so it's desirable for sensors to be as low-noise as possible.

				better noise performance.
				Complementary filter designs were proposed previously \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv,vanHeijningen:2018cpc,low_frequency_optimization_and_performance_of_advanced_virgo_seismic_isolation_system}, but were arguably suboptimal.
				Also, besides heuristics, it was not clear how exactly the filter shapes were constrained according to the sensor noises in question.
				Therefore, we propose to formulate the complementary filter problem as an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ optimization problem and synthesize the filters, which optimally combine the sensors, using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method.
%				In particular, we're interested in using feedback systems that manipulate displacement signals from sensors and feedback to the suspension via actuators.
%				While such control systems are effective in reducing the displacement level suspension at the control band, control noises are introduced at higher frequencies.
%				To satisfy the displacement noise requirements, control regulators need to be roll-off, which limits the amount of attenuation from the feedback system.
%				Since the control noise is dominated by sensing noise, lowering the sensing noise at higher frequencies enables the possibility of a greater control gain at lower frequencies, which makes the optics less susceptible to seismic disturbance.	
%				
%				\medskip
%				
%				Here, we will describe a sensor fusion technique, which combines multiple sensors with different noise characteristics using complementary filters.
%				The combined ``super sensor'' has an overall better noise performance, which can potentially enhance suspension control performance that ultimately translates to a more stable interferometer with lower detector noise.
%				This technique is used particularly for the preisolator stage, which is closest to the ground and furthest from the optics, of the Type-A and Type-B suspensions, where relative displacement sensors and inertial sensors were both used for feedback control.
%				So, we will describe a method that can be used to synthesize complementary filters, using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method, that optimally combine two sensors.

						Fig.~\ref{fig:two-sensor} shows the block diagram typical two-sensor configuration using complementary filters.
						The two sensors are each filtered with $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ respectively.
						The two sensors are measuring a common signal and the super sensor readout must contain the very same signal.
						Hence, the two filters $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ must be complementary, i.e.
						\begin{equation}
							H_1(s) + H_2(s) = 1\,.
							\label{eqn:complementary}

			The super sensor noise then reads
			\begin{equation}
				N_\text{super}(s) = H_1(s)N_1(s) + H_2(s)N_2(s)\,,
				\label{eqn:noise_super}
			\end{equation}
			where $N_1(s)$ and $N_2(s)$ are the sensing noises of the two sensors.
			So, the goal is to design the complementary filters $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)$ such that $N_\text{super}(s)$ is minimized in some sense, or that it exhibits desirable noise characteristics.
			
			\medskip
			
%			In previous work, there were proposed complementary filter designs that tackles the problem by matching the frequency-dependency of the sensing noises and the roll-off of the filter \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv, vanHeijningen:2018cpc}.
%			However, the filter shapes are too simple and is not flexible.
%			Undoubtedly, it is possible to improve the noise performance by better shaping of the filters.
%			Indeed, this was done in \cite{low_frequency_optimization_and_performance_of_advanced_virgo_seismic_isolation_system}, where the filter is shaped to minimize seismic noise coupling in the relative displacement sensors.
%			But, this raises another problem where the filters are tuned manually by heuristics, which may suboptimal and non-reproducible due to the human factor.
%			Therefore, we seek to find a method that can automatically generate optimal complementary filters according to the sensing noises themselves.

					$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method is used to synthesize regulators for feedback systems but is recently proposed for synthesizing complementary filters with frequency-dependent specifications \cite{Thomas:2019}.

			Minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm of this plant will give optimal filters $H_1(s)$ and $H_2(s)\equiv 1-H_1(s)$ that best filter the noises $N_1$ and $N_2$ according to the specifications.
			It follows that, by setting $W_1(s)=1/\hat{N}_2(s)$ and $W_2(s)=1/\hat{N}_1(s)$, the requirements of $N_1$ is set to $N_2$ when $N_1\gg N_2$, and vice versa.
			These weights are reasonable specifications if there's no specific requirements for the sensing noises because over-suppressing one of the noises is not useful, i.e. there exists a lower bound defined by the either $N_1$ or $N_2$, whichever is lower.
			
%			The closed-loop transfer function reads
%			\begin{equation}
%				\mathbf{G}(s) = \begin{bmatrix}H_1(s)\hat{N}_1(s)W_1(s) & H_2(s)\hat{N}_2(s)W_2(s)\end{bmatrix}\,,
%			\end{equation}
%			where we've substitute $(1-H_1(s))$ with $H_2(s)$ due to Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:complementary}.
%			
%			\medskip
%			
%			The plant has a maximum singular value of
%			\begin{equation}
%				\bar\sigma(\mathbf{G}(j\omega)) \approx \max{(H_1(j\omega)\hat{N}_1(j\omega)W_1(j\omega),H_2(j\omega)\hat{N}_2(j\omega)W_2(j\omega))}\,,
%			\end{equation}
%			Now, if we set $W_1(s)=1/\hat{N}_2(s)$ and $W_2(s)=1/\hat{N}_1(s)$, then $\bar\sigma(\mathbf{G}(s))$ can be interpreted as the ratio between the super sensor noise and the lower bound of the sensing noise, assuming that the super sensor noise is dominated one of the filtered sensing noises, which is generally true except at the cross-over frequency.
%			Minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm would then be approximately minimizing the maximum difference of the log super sensor noise and the log noise lower bound.

				With the noise models $\hat{N}_1(s)$ and $\hat{N}_2(s)$, complementary filters are synthesized using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ method with no information other than the sensing noises themselves.
				The resulting complementary filters are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:complementary_filters_hinfinity}.

				%				As can be seen, notch-like feature at around $0.2\,\text{Hz}$ is present in the low pass filter.
				%				complementary filters from advanced LIGO \cite{Matichard:2015} and Virgo \cite{low_frequency_optimization_and_performance_of_advanced_virgo_seismic_isolation_system} also exhibit similar behavior, but the feature is clearly missing from that of \cite{Sekiguchi:2016bmv} and \cite{vanHeijningen:2018cpc}.

			The $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ complementary filters perform better than the other two complementary filters in terms of RMS value especially at the microseism band, which makes it a better candidate for active seismic noise isolation.
